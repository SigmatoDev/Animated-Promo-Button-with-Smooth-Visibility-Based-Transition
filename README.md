Animated Promo Button with Smooth Visibility-Based Transition


An interactive button with a smooth transition that displays a '20% OFF' promotional offer when in the viewport. The button initially shows 'Book Now' and expands with an animation to reveal the promo. The extra layer hides automatically when the button is out of view. Perfect for enhancing user engagement on promotional websites.
